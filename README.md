# Dubmeio homework

I am familiar with the [very_good todo example app]([https://en.wikipedia.org/](https://bloclibrary.dev/tutorials/flutter-todos/)) so I intentionally tried to avoid a similar solution. (Once you see it, you can't unsee it)
The TODOs BLoC and TODO handling is greatly simplified compared to the example app, I tried to make up for it with the routing implementation. 

My widget knowledge is showcased with a moderately complex Sliver layout (<code>SliverPinnedHeaderSection</code>)

Tests are missing!
